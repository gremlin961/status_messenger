# Status Messenger (Python Package Source)

> This document describes the source code of the `status_messenger` Python package. Its primary role is to provide server-side capabilities for queuing status messages from application logic (e.g., agent tools) and making them available for broadcasting to specific client sessions over WebSockets. It uses `contextvars` for session ID management.

This Python package is designed to be used in an asynchronous server environment, like one built with FastAPI or Starlette.

## Core Files and Functionality

The package consists of two main files: `status_messenger/messenger.py` (core logic) and `status_messenger/__init__.py` (package interface).

### `status_messenger/messenger.py`

This file contains the primary implementation.

- **`current_websocket_session_id_var: ContextVar[Optional[str]]`**
  - A `contextvars.ContextVar` instance.
  - **Purpose:** To store the WebSocket session ID of the client currently being processed in the current asynchronous task's context. This allows `add_status_message` to implicitly know which session a status update belongs to without requiring `session_id` to be passed explicitly through all application layers.
  - **Usage:** Set by the main application (e.g., `main.py` in a WebSocket endpoint) before agent logic runs, and reset afterwards.

- **`AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE: Optional[asyncio.Queue[Tuple[Optional[str], str]]]`**
  - An `asyncio.Queue`.
  - **Purpose:** To buffer status messages as `(session_id, message_text)` tuples. `session_id` can be `None` if not found in the context, allowing the broadcaster to handle such cases.
  - **Initialized by:** `setup_status_messenger_async`.

- **`_loop: Optional[asyncio.AbstractEventLoop]`**
  - Stores the asyncio event loop instance.
  - **Purpose:** Used by `add_status_message` to safely schedule queue operations from potentially synchronous contexts (like agent tools not running in the loop's thread).
  - **Set by:** `setup_status_messenger_async`.

- **GCP Pub/Sub Globals (within `messenger.py`)**
  - **`_pubsub_publisher: Optional[pubsub_v1.PublisherClient]`**: Stores the initialized Google Cloud Pub/Sub publisher client if Pub/Sub is enabled and configured. `None` otherwise.
  - **`_pubsub_topic_path: Optional[str]`**: Stores the fully qualified path to the Pub/Sub topic. `None` if not configured.
  - **`_pubsub_enabled: bool`**: A flag indicating whether Pub/Sub publishing is active. Determined by environment variables and successful client initialization.

- **`_pubsub_callback(future: Any) -> None`**
  - **Purpose:** A callback function attached to the `Future` returned by the Pub/Sub `publish` call.
  - **Logic:** Logs the result of the publish operation (success with message ID or failure with error).

- **`setup_status_messenger_async(loop: asyncio.AbstractEventLoop) -> None`**
  - **Purpose:** Initializes the `_loop` variable, creates the `AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE`, and attempts to initialize GCP Pub/Sub publishing.
  - **Pub/Sub Initialization Logic:**
    1. Checks if `google-cloud-pubsub` library is installed.
    2. Reads environment variables:
       - `STATUS_MESSENGER_PUBSUB_ENABLED`: If "true", attempts to enable Pub/Sub.
       - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`: GCP Project ID.
       - `STATUS_MESSENGER_PUBSUB_TOPIC_ID`: Pub/Sub Topic ID.
    3. If all conditions are met (library present, env vars set), it initializes `_pubsub_publisher` and `_pubsub_topic_path`.
    4. Sets `_pubsub_enabled` to `True` on success, `False` otherwise, logging appropriate messages.
  - **Called:** Typically once at server startup by the main application.

- **`add_status_message(message: str) -> None`**
  - **Purpose:** The primary function for application/agent code to send a status update.
  - **Logic:**
    1. Retrieves the `websocket_session_id` using `current_websocket_session_id_var.get()`.
    2. Logs the message with the session ID (or 'UnknownSession' if ID is `None`).
    3. Puts the `(websocket_session_id, message)` tuple onto `AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE`.
    4. Uses `_loop.call_soon_threadsafe` to enqueue the message, making it safe to call from synchronous code that might be running in a different thread than the event loop. Includes a fallback to `put_nowait` for calls from within the loop's thread.

- **`stream_status_updates() -> AsyncIterator[Tuple[Optional[str], str]]`**
  - **Purpose:** An asynchronous generator for the message broadcaster (in `main.py`) to consume.
  - **Logic:**
    1. Checks if `AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE` is initialized; if not, it returns (effectively an empty async generator).
    2. Enters an infinite loop:
       - Asynchronously gets a `(session_id, message)` tuple from `AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE.get()`.
       - `yield`s the tuple.
       - Calls `AGENT_MESSAGE_QUEUE.task_done()`.

### `status_messenger/__init__.py`

This file defines the public interface of the `status_messenger` package.

- **Exports:**
  - `add_status_message`
  - `setup_status_messenger_async`
  - `stream_status_updates`
  - (Note: `current_websocket_session_id_var` is *not* exported by `__init__.py`; applications like `main.py` import it directly from `status_messenger.messenger`.)
  - `publish_agent_event`

- **`publish_agent_event(event_data: Dict[str, Any], event_type: str = "agent_event") -> None`**
  - **Purpose:** To publish structured event data to the configured GCP Pub/Sub topic.
  - **Logic:**
    1. Checks if `_pubsub_enabled` is `True` and if the publisher and topic path are configured. If not, logs a warning and returns.
    2. Retrieves the `websocket_session_id` using `current_websocket_session_id_var.get()`.
    3. Constructs a JSON payload containing:
       - `websocket_session_id`
       - `event_type`
       - `timestamp` (UTC ISO format)
       - `data` (the provided `event_data` dictionary)
    4. Serializes the payload to UTF-8 encoded JSON bytes.
    5. Defines an inner function `do_publish` that:
       - Calls `_pubsub_publisher.publish()` with the topic path and data.
       - Attaches `_pubsub_callback` to the `Future` returned by `publish()`.
    6. Schedules `do_publish` to run on the event loop using `_loop.call_soon_threadsafe`. This ensures the Pub/Sub client's publish method (which might have its own async/threading considerations) is called from the loop's thread.
    7. Logs success or failure of submitting the event for publishing. Actual publish confirmation comes via `_pubsub_callback`.

## Design Notes and Patterns

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverages `asyncio` for non-blocking message queuing and streaming, suitable for modern Python web frameworks.
- **Implicit Context for Session ID:** Uses `contextvars` to avoid explicit `session_id` passing through all layers of agent code down to the status update call. The main application server is responsible for setting this context.
- **Thread Safety for Message Submission:** `add_status_message` uses `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` to allow synchronous agent tools (which might run in separate threads managed by an agent framework) to safely submit messages to the asyncio queue.
- **Decoupling:** The messenger service itself is decoupled from WebSocket handling; it only manages a queue. The main application's broadcaster component is responsible for taking messages from the queue and sending them over WebSockets.
